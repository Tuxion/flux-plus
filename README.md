# FluxPlus - pre-release version

Facebooks Flux principles have not been formalized into a full-stack framework yet.
FluxPlus does not attempt to tackle this problem all at once but instead formalizes
some additional principles and ideas to take you one step closer to a framework.

FluxPlus provides several base classes to work with in addition to the existing
Flux dispatcher. Using this you can quickly implement a skeleton framework of your own.
